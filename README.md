# CS50x 2020

Documenting my progress through [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) from Harvard. Open to feedback and discussion. I also hope this can be helpful to other students :)

> Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and
> the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think
> algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include
> abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource
> management, security, and software engineering.
